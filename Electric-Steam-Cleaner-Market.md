The increase in demand for versatile cleaning equipment that can effectively eliminate dirt, grease, and allergens adds to this optimistic outlook. Additionally, the rise in urbanization and busy lifestyles has led to a higher adoption rate of electric steam cleaners in both residential and commercial settings.</p> <p>One of the key drivers of market growth is the innovation in steam cleaning technology, which has led to the development of more efficient and user-friendly products.
